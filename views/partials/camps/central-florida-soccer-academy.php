                    <strong>Central Florida Soccer Academy College ID Camp</strong><br />
                    CFSA College ID camps are designed for the advanced field player and goalkeeper who need more tactical training under high pressure. This one-day camp is designed to provide maximum exposure to those players seeking opportunities to play college soccer. The top focus is identification and a variety of challenging technical and tactical drills to bring out the best in each player. Our success is built on the 3-tier philosophy of player development: technical, tactical and competition. Players will receive tactical and technical-skill training from elite coaches during the morning session. The afternoon will consist of small-sided games played under high pressure where players can work on techniques and strategies learned that morning.
