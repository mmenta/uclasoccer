		<h1>About Amanda</h1>
		<p>
			This past season, Cromwell led UCLA to its first-ever national championship in women's soccer. Capping a remarkable season at the College Cup in North Carolina, the Bruins defeated three number-one seeds and two of the last three national champions en route to UCLA's record 110th NCAA Championship. UCLA finished the year with a record of 22-1-3, winning the Pac-12 and going unbeaten in its last 21 games. Cromwell, in just her first season in Westwood, became the first UCLA coach ever to be honored as Soccer America's Women's Coach of the Year.
			<br /><br />
			The two-time All-American from the University of Virginia brings great experience to the sidelines as a coach. Cromwell started her career as an assistant at UVA, then became head coach at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County. She then took the helm at UCF for 14 years, leading the Knights to four Atlantic Sun Championship Titles, six CUSA Championship Titles and 11 NCAA post-season appearances, advancing to the Elite 8 in 2011. With 246 career victories, Cromwell currently ranks among the top-25 winningest active coaches and the top-30 all-time winningest coaches in NCAA history.
			<br /><br />
			Following her standout playing career in Charlottesville, Cromwell earned 55 caps while representing the U.S. Women's National Team. She was a member of the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup bronze medal team and was an alternate for the gold medal-winning Olympic team in 1996. She later played professionally for the Washington Freedom, Atlanta Beat and the San Jose CyberRays of the Women's United Soccer Association, and was inducted into the Virginia-DC Soccer Hall of Fame.
